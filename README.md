*Project created to fulfil final requirement of the School of Continuing Studies Machine Learning Course (SCS_3253_047 Machine Learning)

The objective of this project to find an algorithm which predicts readmission of diabetic patients. Predicting the readmission of diabetic patients will help reduce hospital costs and improve the quality of health care.

*Data Set Information*
The dataset includes (1999-2008) 10 years of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It consists of 101 766 records with 71 515 of unique diabetic patients and has 50 variables related to demographics and medication and hospital interaction information.
